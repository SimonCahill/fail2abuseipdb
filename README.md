# fail2abuseipdb

fail2abuseipdb is a server administration tool (currently WIP!) which allows server administrators to **easily** and **automagically** convert
fail2ban's output (which a weird semi-JSON format) to a CSV-format which can directly be published to abuseipdb!

# To-Do

In no particular order, the to-dos are as follows. I just hope I update them ðŸ«£

 1) ~~Add version information during build~~ Working
 2) ~~Add install target~~ Working
 3) ~~Add remove target~~ Use deb instead
 4) ~~Build deb-package?!~~ Working
 5) ~~Add pipe support~~ Working
 6) ~~Add support for calling fail2ban directly~~ Working, except for automagic search
 7) Clean up code for first *real* release
 8) Add debug messages (printed to stderr)
 9) Unit tests? Don't really care for them
 10) Add support for adding/overriding categories (both default and per jail)
